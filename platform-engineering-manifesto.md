# Manifesto for Platform Engineering

We are uncovering better ways of creating 

platforms and improving the Developer Experience by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools (Kubernetes doesn't solve it all)

**Building modules and components for thin platforms** over comprehensive and all-in-one automagic ones

**Listening to developer feedback** over business driven requirements

**Tailoring the platform to developer needs** over enforcing  strict standards

That is, while there is value in the items on

the right, we value the items on the left more.

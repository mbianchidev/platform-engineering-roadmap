# Plaform Engineering Roadmap

An opinionated roadmap to become a Platform Engineer.

The roadmap is inspired by [Teivah's SRE roadmap](https://github.com/teivah/sre-roadmap), but my idea is a bit different.
In time, I want to create something similar to [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) but for Platform Engineers.

This picture is from my DevOpsDay Amsterdam 2024 talk - Platform Engineering's Inferno - you can find a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWn48x4v34Q).

I want this roadmap to be useful to the largest amount of people and if you want to help you are very welcome. Any contribution matters, may that be an input, a feedback or a PR.

_Note: This repo also contains a [Platform Engineering Manifesto](platform-engineering-manifesto.md) which is playfully inspired by the Agile Manifesto._

## Note

The previous readme content can be found in [LEGACY.md](LEGACY.md) all new updates will be in the interactive website instead.
